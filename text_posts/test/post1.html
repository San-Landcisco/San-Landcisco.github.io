Climate and Human History
	Throughout all of human history, as determined by archaeological study of the past, human cultural and biological patterns have been largely attributed to differences in climate. There is a tendency to explain the past actions of humankind as being necessary consequences of a single antecedent: the environment it has existed within. Generally, this paradigm is reasonably applied to time periods which dramatically predate recorded history. However, there is a growing school in which increasingly modern acts and ideas throughout history are explained in the same way—with some even extending to events in the present day. While this scheme of interpretation is useful in understanding the actions of groups without advanced social machinery and organization (in line with our current understanding of the evolutionary predecessors of modern homo sapiens), it erroneously underplays the role of the development of technology and the evolution of civil organization and their effects on populations. These factors arguably have the larger hand in directing human action upon the development of the first societies. As humans first organized themselves together in larger groups instead of spreading wide and moving with the available resources, they became less dependent on variations in climate.
	One of the classical examples of human-environment interaction in which climate is demonstrated to be an influential factor in the movement of human populations, is the last glacial maximum and the subsequent recession of the North American continental glacier. The most widely accepted and oldest theory successfully explaining the populating of the Americas, the Beringia Hypothesis, relies on the melting of this glacier as a driving force for human movement. Revealing the larger part of the North American grasslands, the movement provided fresh territory for both the expansion of the deciduous forests and opportunistic migratory animal groups. As a result, migrating bodies of fauna hunted by humans of the period filled the newly freed environments, followed by their human predators.
	In this explanation, the role played by an intelligent decision maker is completely annulled. Movements of these populations of humans are treated with the same tools applied by biologists studying the movement of populations of other animals. What makes this approach reasonable is in part the nature of human societies during the period. They were largely nomadic, not organized in any kind of hierarchal structure. Without strong roots in any particular region, the influence of urbanism was null and people therefore moved according to resource availability. The lack of a network on top of a set of developed resources and of centralization accounts for the tendency to more closely follow what resources their environments provided. Lower levels of automation and the absence of exploitable forms of centralized resource production kept these groups more mobile and hence more reliant on chance—they were followers of their environment because they had the infrastructure to do nothing else.
	A similar story is seen in the case of the Younger Dryas, a climatological rapid cooling of the Earth which took place c. 12,900 – 11,700 BP. Over a span of decades, global temperatures dropped by 2 to 6 degrees Celsius and local conditions became more arid leaving the Earth in the longest interruption to the trend towards global warming since the Last Glacial Maximum occurring almost 15,000 years before. This event has been linked to the decline of both the Clovis culture in North America and a transition away from Natufian sedentism in the Levant. In both cases, societies were becoming increasingly reliant on agriculture as a means of centralized resource development and, without diverse means of food production, a quick and dramatic change in the environment was able to significantly impact their livelihood. Natufian groups again became more mobile and the Clovis culture dissolved into the wide range of societies which thereafter collectively dominated the two continents.
	While in the above cases the environmental explanation is most plausible, this same approach becomes problematic when applied to situations involving more complex civilizations. This is particularly true when the aforementioned civilizations maintain technology designed to counteract the effects of a given climate. An example of this is seen in the present day habitation of regions which to our ancestors would have been inaccessible or simply unsustainable (i.e., temporary habitation of Antarctica, cities in deserts otherwise prohibitively far from water sources, etc.). Water distribution, heating, electronics, and rapid transit have made even the most barren parts of the Earth at least temporarily habitable despite their sometimes extreme climates. 
	One of the most significant flaws with this technique of answering questions about the human past is that it requires little first-hand interaction with the archaeological record. This distance can lead to hasty conclusions being drawn, straying far from an objective assessment of the relevant and particular facts of a situation. The approach relies heavily on correlations between climate data and significant events in human history, but puts forth comparatively little effort to establish clear lines of causation. The tendency is to look for correlations and then find an explanation. A slight temperature difference observed to be present during the fall of a civilization could be said to be the cause without pausing to consider the socio-political atmosphere within the civilization itself. 
Moreover, it’s neglected to acknowledge how, unlike other organisms in nature, humans have a singularly directed and intentional effect on their environment. This is to such an extent that it seems simplistic to assume that data involving climate alone can account for the large-scale changes across human society at any point in time after the beginning of civilization. Additionally, this approach has the flaw of being overly reductionist in trying to explain as complex phenomena as the actions of potentially gigantic groups of people in terms of very few points of data about the environmental conditions. While in most cases simplification is elegant, it becomes misguided when it is at the expense of specificity or relevant detail.
	A reasonable counter-argument in favor of the environmental approach (and an appeal frequently made by its proponents) involves an application of Occam’s Razor. At first glance, the fact that this sort of deterministic environmental thought has broad success describing the actions of the rest of the animal kingdom makes the argument that humans need different consideration seem like special pleading. There has to be a reason that humankind is attributed more agency against its environment than the rest of nature whose actions we explain entirely in terms of the varying climatological and environmental conditions present. However, unlike any other species of nature, humans have seized control of their environment and manipulate it, creating their own set of rules. Especially in the development of advanced technologies, from agriculture to mass transportation and communication, humans have found means to regulate their environment such that differences in climate have become less significant. While in the past, with simpler and more fragile means of organization, humans were more susceptible to the influence of their environment, with changes both in technology and in social organization, the most important factor determining biological and cultural change became our own actions.
